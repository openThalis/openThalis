# openThalis - Code quality assessment of this version

## Overall Score: **72/100** (Beta/Experimental)

### This release is a beta/experimental version to get feedback from the community. Please use it with caution and report any issues you find. Feedback & feature requests are welcome and appreciated.

## üéØ **Project Status**
Thalis demonstrates **solid architectural foundations** with a modern tech stack, but requires security hardening and development practice improvements before production deployment.

## ‚úÖ **Strengths**
- **Modern Architecture**: Well-structured FastAPI backend + Rust frontend with clear separation of concerns
- **Feature Complete**: Full-stack AI agent platform with chat, task management, file handling, real-time communication, and more
- **Async-First Design**: Proper async/await patterns throughout Python codebase
- **Multiple AI Providers**: Support for OpenAI, Ollama, and xAI integration (can easily be extended to other providers)
- **Real-time Communication**: WebSocket implementation for responsive user experience

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Critical Security Issues** 
**Must be addressed before public beta:**
- **Filesystem API Exposure**: Local file operations lack authentication (Critical)
- **Open CORS Configuration**: `allow_origin_regex=".*"` enables unrestricted access
- **Dangerous Tools**: Shell command execution without proper sandboxing

## üîß **Development Priorities**
1. **Add Comprehensive Testing** - No test suite currently exists
2. **Implement Structured Logging** - Replace debug print statements
3. **Security Hardening** - Address filesystem and CORS vulnerabilities  
4. **Documentation** - Add docs and inline code documentation
5. **Type Safety** - Expand type hints across codebase

## üìä **Score Breakdown**
- Architecture & Design: **18/20**
- Security: **12/20** ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Code Quality: **14/20**
- Testing: **5/20** ‚ùå
- Documentation: **9/20**
- Performance: **14/20**
